# Map_creator developed by Matej Kurinec.

This project is focused on creating 2-dimensional map using robot, 
that was made by myself. This robot worked on principle of 
measuring distances of objects that are in front of him. 
Next based on measured values it creates map of environment and 
draw this map on user interface. 

All source code and documentation is included in project folder. Documentation contains also
demov from measuring and creating environment map.

Hope you like it... :-)
